**Amerigo** is a map-centered blogging platform for travellers. It evolved from a sandbox I was using to experiment with LeafletJS and Picasa: the code is not really what you want to see in production, but it does the job, and may be helpful to take cue for other projects...

**Sorry**, couldn't make it to write **documentation** before taking off! There are some comments in the code: feel free to email me if you need anything
